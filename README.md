# 👋 Hi, I'm Sarah Al

I'm a mathematician and statistician passionate about **Bayesian learning**, **machine learning**, and using data to solve real-world problems in **biostatistics** and **finance**.

🧠 Currently building a portfolio of applied projects focused on:
- Bayesian health risk modeling
- ML for credit scoring and risk analytics
- Reproducible workflows and clear statistical communication

🔧 Tools I Use:
- **Python**: `PyMC`, `scikit-learn`, `pandas`, `ArviZ`
- **R**: `brms`, `rstanarm`, `tidyverse`
- **Other**: `Jupyter`, `Quarto`, `Streamlit`, `Git`

📌 Featured Projects (coming soon):
- 📊 Bayesian survival analysis on public health data
- 💳 Machine learning model for loan default prediction
- 📈 Visual dashboards for model uncertainty & inference
