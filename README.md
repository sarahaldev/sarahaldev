# ğŸ‘‹ Hi, I'm Sarah Al

Welcome to my GitHub!

I'm a mathematician and statistician with a growing passion for **Bayesian learning**, **machine learning**, and using data to solve real-world problems in **biostatistics** and **banking**.

ğŸ’¡ I believe in blending theory with practice â€” using code to bring complex models to life and make data-driven insights accessible and actionable.

### ğŸ§  What I'm Working On:
- ğŸ”¬ Bayesian models for health and medical research
- ğŸ“‰ Predictive analytics and risk modeling in finance
- ğŸ›  Reproducible, well-documented statistical workflows

### ğŸ”§ Tools I Use:
- **Python**: `PyMC`, `scikit-learn`, `pandas`, `ArviZ`
- **R**: `brms`, `tidyverse`, `rstanarm`
- **Other**: `Jupyter`, `Streamlit`, `Git`, `Quarto`

### ğŸ“Œ Featured Projects (coming soon):
- Bayesian survival models with medical datasets
- ML-based credit risk scoring
- Visual dashboards for model uncertainty
